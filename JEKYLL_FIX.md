# Jekyll build instructions for GitHub Pages

# This file was temporarily created as .nojekyll but should not exist
# GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default and we want that functionality

# To fix build errors:
# 1. Remove .nojekyll file
# 2. Use proper _config.yml
# 3. Disable problematic workflows
# 4. Use supported Jekyll plugins only
